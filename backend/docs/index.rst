Introduction
------------

I'm `Marc Skov Madsen`_, PhD, CFA® and Lead Data Scientist Developer at Ørsted_.

I'm a knowledge expert in

- Data, Models and Analytics applying methods and tools from Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Business Intelligence, System Development, Financial Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Robotics.
- Asset Management of both financial and physical assets from +14 years of working in the Financial and Energy sectors with Analysis, Modelling, Trading, Operation, Finance and Risk Management.

The Data, Models and Analytics platform is build on my favourite paradigm for applications for data, models and analytics in an enterprise setting. This platform can handle many data and data with a lot of business/ domain complexity. It is not a paradigm for "Big Data" though.
