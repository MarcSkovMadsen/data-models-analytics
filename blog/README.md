# The Data, Models and Analytics Blog

## Introduction

The purpose of the Data, Models and Analytics Blog is to

- provide a method for writing and sharing my thoughts and learnings on Data, Models and Analytics.

The blog is a static site generated by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). Pelican is based on Python. Read through [Quickstart](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html) for an introduction.

### Linting

Linting highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your source code.

#### Pylint

We use pylint to lint python code.

An example is

```bash
$ pylint hello_world.py
************* Module hello_world.py:1:0: C0111: Missing module docstring (missing-docstring)
```

Please note:

- The settings for pylint are defined in the .pylintrc file.
- You can configure editors like VS Code and Pycharm to automatically run pylint when you save a file.

#### VS Code MarkdownLint

If you use the editor VS Code you can use the [vscode-markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) extension to lint Markdown files.

Please note:

- The settings for vscode-markdownlint can be found in the content/.markdownlint.json file.
